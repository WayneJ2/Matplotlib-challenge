# Matplotlib-challenge (Pymaceuticals Inc.)

## Purpose
To generate all tables and figures for the varied drug study technical report. Develop a top-level summary of the trends found.

## Description
The **_[MatplotlibCode.ipynb](https://github.com/WayneJ2/Matplotlib-challenge/blob/main/MatplotlibCode.ipynb)_** contains tables and figures for the study results. 


## Table of Figures

1. Summary Statistics - Mean, Median, Var, Std. Dev., Std Error tables
2. Bar and Pie Charts
    1. Number of Mice tested vs Drug Regimen
    2. Distribution of Mice Sexes
3. Quartiles, Outliers, and Boxplots
    1.  Final Tumor Volumes of mice for chosen treatment regimens
    2.  Chosen treatment's Boxplots, IQRs and Outliers
3. Line and Scatter plots
    1.   Sample Capomulin treatment of single mouse
    2.   Scatter plot w/trendline of Average Tumor Volumes vs Mice Weights on capomulin Regimen

## Drug Treatment Study Analysis

1. All tumor volumes acreoss al regimens averaged 40-54mm3.
2. Chosen 4 regimens for futher analysis showed the lowest variance and errors in tumor volume:
    1. Capomulin- Var: 25 , Std Err: 0.33
    2. Ceftamin- Var: 39 , Std Err: 0.0.46
    3. Infubinol- Var: 43 , Std Err: 0.49
    4. Ramicane- Var: 23 , Std Err: 0.32
3. Study included roughly 50/50 distribution of mice sexes.
4. Capomulin and Ramicane top regimens with a sample of over 200 tested mice.
5. Capomulin and Ramicane showed lowest avg fnal tumor volumes.
6. One mouse sampled on Capomulin showed a 21% decrease in tumor volume over a 40 day period.
7. Capomulin showed a strong positive correlation of 0.84 showing a strong relationship between mice weights and avg tumor volumes.
8. On Capumulin treatment, avg tumor volume was directly proportional to weight of mice.
